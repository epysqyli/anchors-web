Anchors is a Nostr client that implements the core parts of this protocol in order to allow users to share and fetch notes (traditionally called posts) to and from Nostr relays.</p><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">Examples of already established nostr clients can be found <!#><!/>.</p><h3 class="text-xl mt-5 mb-2 underline underline-offset-4">Why Anchors</h3><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">The goal of Anchors is that of providing a minimalistic social network experience centered around sharing notes <b>based on other references</b>: this means that a note can never be written and posted to the nostr relays if it's devoid of reference tags.</p><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">A reference is nothing but a link to an external resource: it might be an article, a podcast, a song, a book, etc. that prompted the idea that the user wants to write down and share with the rest of the network. This constraint is in place because the aim of Anchors is not that of being a clone of existing social media, where people randomly share whatever comes to mind, but instead wants to be a platform where users share the precious insights that they come up with while, for example, reading a particular book or article.</p><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">With references in place anchoring ideas, users can then check all the other ideas that have the same reference as their basis. This will hopefully create a place where interesting concepts can be explored without users drowning in a sea of noise.</p><h3 class="text-xl mt-5 mb-2 underline underline-offset-4">Why on Nostr</h3><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">This app could have been built with a centralized database at its core, but centralization means control: creating an app where ideas are crucial and making it dependent on a centralized database means that users can potentially lose access to the ideas shared via posts. Nostr prevents this via its network of relays.</p><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">Moreover, being on Nostr, all Nostr users can use their existing identities to use Anchors without needing to create a new profile in a closed network that would probably never garner attention on its own.</p><h3 class="text-xl mt-5 mb-2 underline underline-offset-4">How to get started</h3><p class="mb-5 text-justify tracking-tight xl:tracking-normal text-base">Create a public/private key pair using an extension like <!#><!/> on Chrome.
